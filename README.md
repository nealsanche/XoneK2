# XoneK2

This repository is a simple device driver to get the Allen & Heath Xone:K2 midi control surface functional in Reason 11. The device driver 
here doesn't set up any preconfigured device mappings for any of the Reason devices, but it will allow you to midi map any of the controls
to anything in Reason you want to control, including buttons, sliders, dials.

# Installing

The files inside this folder need to be copied into the correct folders on your Mac or Windows machine.

On a Mac:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Propellerhead Software
```

And on Windows:

```
~\AppData\Local\Propellerhead Software
```

# Once Installed Correctly

Once you get these files installed correctly, you will be able to add the Xone:K2 as a control surface in Reason. The device needs to be set up so that the
layer button switches between the red, orange, and green layers... so effectively you will be able to control three times the devices attached to Reason.
So, have fun.
